    <p class="hatter">
        Alice is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister. She then notices a
        talking, clothed White Rabbit with a pocket watch run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole when suddenly she
        falls a long way to a curious hall
        with many locked doors of all sizes.</p>

    <p class="hatter">She finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it she sees an
        attractive garden.
        She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled "DRINK ME," the contents of which cause her to shrink
        too small to reach the key which she has left on the table.</p>

    <p class="hatter">She eats a cake with "EAT ME" written on it in currants as the chapter closes. Alice is feeling
